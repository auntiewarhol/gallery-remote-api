=head1 NAME

Gallery::Remote::API - Perl Module to access the Gallery Remote Protocol


=head1 VERSION

This document describes Gallery::Remote::API version 0.0.1


=head1 SYNOPSIS
	
	use Gallery::Remote::API;

	my $gallery = new Gallery::Remote::API (
		url => $url, version => $ver, username => $user, password => $pass
	);

	$gallery->login || die "can't log in!";


	## Then...

	if (my $result = $gallery->fetch_albums) { #etc
		# success! $result is a hashref of returned data
	}
	else {
		# failed! But we can still get $result, to see the error
		my $result = $gallery->result;
		print "error = " . $result->status_text;
	}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

"Gallery" is a PHP web photo gallery package; this module allows you to
interact with their Remote Protocol API. It is an alternative to
Gallery::Remote, which at this time is incomplete, and does not appear to
support Gallery2.


=head1 INTERFACE - COMMON METHODS

These are the general-purpose methods you'll use to interact with this class.

=head2 C<new>

	my $gallery = new Gallery::Remote::API (
		url => $url, version => $ver, username => $user, password => $pass
	);

Constructs a new Gallery::Remote::API object. Arguments, which must be passed as
a hashref, are as follows:

=over 4

=item B<url> (required)

The main url to your Gallery installation, e.g. "mygallerysite.com", or
"http://mybigbadsite.com/galleries/". The 'http://' is optional. Can be
passed as either a string or as a L<URI> object.

=item B<version>

The (major) version of your Gallery installation.
Accepted values are '1' or '2'; defaults to '2'.

=item B<username>

=item B<password>

The Gallery username and password under which you wish to log in

=back


=head2 C<result>

	my $result = $gallery->result

Returns a hashref containing the deserialized data tree resulting from the
most recently performed request. This is the same data that is returned from
a successful request, but you'll need this to get the error message on a fail.

The $result data will ALWAYS contain at least the following:

	{ status => $status_code, status_text => $message }

A status of '0' indicates a success, any other value is an error code.
'Proper' Remote Protocol error codes will be numeric, and the status_text
will describe the error.

See L<http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery_Remote:Protocol#Appendix_A> for the
current list of status codes.

In the event that we fail to contact the remote server at all, we provide
the following, which includes the HTTP::Response object itself:

	{ status => 'server_error', status_text => $http_response->status_line,
		response => $http_response }

All other data included in the $result is contextual to the request that
was made.


=head2 C<response>

	my $response = $gallery->response;

Returns the raw, un-deserialized response data resulting from the most
recently performed request. Data is formatted in a Java "Properties" stream,
exactly as returned by the Gallery Remote Protocol.

I don't know why you'd want it, but it's there if you need it.

=head2 C<url>

=head2 C<username>

=head2 C<password>

=head2 C<version>

	my $url = $gallery->url; #etc

Read-only accessors to retrieve the data you assigned on construction. Again
I don't know why you'd ever need them, but they're there.


=head1 INTERFACE - PROTOCOL COMMAND METHODS

These are the methods which perform specific commands correlating to their
similarly named equivalents as specified by the Protocol.

=head2 C<login>

	$gallery->login
		|| die "Can't log in: " . $gallery->result->{status_text};

Logs into the Gallery installation using the username and password that were
passed to the constructor. Not strictly necessary, as you may operate as a
"Guest", just like on the site, but you probably can't do much in that case.

=head2 C<fetch_albums>

=head2 C<fetch_albums_prune>

=head2 C<add_item>

=head2 C<album_properties>

=head2 C<new_album>

=head2 C<fetch_album_images>

=head2 C<move_album>

=head2 C<increment_view_count>

=head2 C<image_properties>

=head2 C<no_op>

Each of the above executes the corresponding command against the protocol.
Usage of each is identical:

	#general form

	my $result = $gallery->method_name(\%params) ||
		my $error_result = $gallery->result;

	#example

	my $result = $gallery->fetch_albums({ no_perms => 'yes' })) ||
		print "error = " . $gallery->result->{status_text} ."\n";

The parameters that can be passed to each individual method are documented
in the Gallery Codex at L<http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery_Remote:Protocol>

In order to keep this module flexible, and reasonably backward-and-forward
compatible, we do no checking whatsover on what parameters you send, we let
it be between you and the remote server to determine what should or
shouldn't work.

However, you do NOT need to send the B<cmd> or B<protocol_version> parameters,
the module will handle these two for you. If you do send B<cmd>, it will be
ignored. However if you send B<protocol_version>, your value will be used
instead of the default (protocol_version = 2.9 as of this release).

I allow this because I can't find any good documentation regarding why we
send that parameter, or what happens when it changes, so I'll let you
overwrite it, if that helps you. If nothing else I imagine it may prove
useful for forward compatibility.

Also note, you do not need to specify your Gallery2 parameters in the

	g2_form[parametername]

format. Just use the parameter name itself, we will wrap it in the g2_form[].

Finally let me emphasize one point regarding parameterd from Gallery's docs
that bit me until I remembered:

B<album "names" and image "names" are actually the unique identifier (an 
integer) of the object in G2, rather than an alphanumeric name>


=head2 C<execute_command>
	
	my $result = $gallery->execute_command($command,\%params) ||
		my $error_result = $gallery->result;

C<execute_command> is the method which all of the above convenience methods
actually call underneath. I make it public again for forward/backward
compatibility -- you can use this method directly if there's an old or new
command available that you need, that we haven't covered with a convenience
method.

It works just like the methods above, except that you must pass the name
of the command to be executed as the first argument. Use the Gallery-native
form of the command, e.g. "fetch-albums", not "fetch_albums".


=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
  
Gallery::Remote::API requires no configuration files or environment variables.

L<Class::Accessor>

L<URI>

L<URI::QueryParam>

L<HTTP::Cookies>

L<File::Temp>

L<Config::Properties>

L<Sub::Name>

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported.


=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

No bugs have been reported.

Limitations: this module has been tested and runs fine against a server
running Gallery Version 2.3.1, which reports server_version 2.14 (which I
believe to be the same as the protocol_version? But it's the newest release
and the docs say the protocol goes to 2.9? And what's up with different
protocol_versions for Gallery1 vs Gallery2, do I care? Their documents are
somewhat thin and frustrating. But hey, it's open source, and I'm not 
volunteering). So, YMMV as to whether this works for your installation, and
any input to help make sure this thing works for any implementation is
appreciated.

Please report any bugs or feature requests to
C<bug-gallery-remoteapi@rt.cpan.org>, or through the web interface at
L<http://rt.cpan.org>.
